# Brian's Rescue

## Introduction

Brian's Rescue is an engaging maze game built for Farcaster, where players help Brian escape from Gary at the SEC offices. Using Farcaster casts, players control Brian with commands like `!movebrian <direction>`. Navigate through the office to find the path to freedom. Incorrect moves send Brian back to the last checkpoint. This group-based game allows multiple players to control Brian by casting commands.

Designed for deployment on Vercel, the game utilizes Vercel's KV store, ensuring a serverless and stateless architecture.
